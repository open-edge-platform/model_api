# Benchmark - a metrics API example

This example demonstrates how to use the Python API of OpenVINO Model API for performance analysis and metrics collection during model inference. This tutorial includes the following features:

- Model performance measurement
- Configurable device selection (CPU, GPU, etc.)
- Automatic image dataset discovery
- Warm-up and test runs with customizable parameters
- Detailed inference time analysis
- Metrics logging and reporting
- Performance statistics calculation

## Prerequisites

Install Model API from source. Please refer to the main [README](../../../README.md) for details.

## Run example

To run the example, please execute the following command:

```bash
python benchmark.py <model_path> <dataset_path> [options]
```

### Required Arguments

- `model_path` - Path to the model file (.xml)
- `dataset_path` - Path to the dataset directory containing test images

### Optional Arguments

- `--device` - Device to run the model on (default: CPU)
- `--warmup-runs` - Number of warmup runs (default: 5)
- `--test-runs` - Number of test runs (default: 100)

### Examples

```bash
# Basic usage with CPU
python benchmark.py /path/to/model.xml /path/to/images

# Use GPU with custom parameters
python benchmark.py /path/to/model.xml /path/to/images --device GPU --warmup-runs 10 --test-runs 50

# Show help
python benchmark.py --help
```

## Expected Output

The example will display:

- Number of images found in the dataset directory
- Progress updates during warm-up and test phases
- Comprehensive performance analysis results including timing statistics
- Detailed metrics about the model's inference performance on the specified device
