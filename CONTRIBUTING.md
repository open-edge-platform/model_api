- Creating a Pull Request (PR)
- Becoming a maintainer

## Bug Report

We use GitHub issues to track the bugs. Report a bug by using [Issues](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/model_api/issues/new) page.

## Feature Request

We utilize GitHub issues to track the feature requests as well. If you are certain regarding the feature you are interested and have a solid proposal, you could then create the feature request by [Issues](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/model_api/issues/new) page.

## Development & PRs

We actively welcome your pull requests:

### Getting Started

#### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

First, fork the Model API repository by following the GitHub documentation on [forking a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo). Then, clone your forked repository to your local machine and create a new branch from `master`.

#### 2. Set Up Your Development Environment

Set up your development environment to start contributing. This involves installing the required dependencies and setting up pre-commit hooks for code quality checks. Note that this guide assumes you are using [Venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for python environments management. However, the steps are similar for other env managers.

1. Create a new python environment and install the development requirements:

   ```bash
   uv sync --all-extras
   ```

</details>

### Making Changes

1. **Write Code:** Follow the project's coding standards and write your code with clear intent. Ensure your code is well-documented and includes examples where appropriate. For code quality we use ruff, whose configuration is in [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml) file.

2. **Add Tests:** If your code includes new functionality, add corresponding tests using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/) to maintain coverage and reliability.

3. **Update Documentation:** If you've changed APIs or added new features, update the documentation accordingly. Ensure your docstrings are clear and follow [Google's docstring guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings).

4. **Pass Tests and Quality Checks:** Ensure the test suite passes and that your code meets quality standards by running:

   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit run --all-files
   uv run pytest tests/unit
   uv run python tests/precommit/prepare_data.py -d data -p tests/precommit/public_scope.json
   uv run pytest --data=./data tests/functional
   uv run python tests/accuracy/prepare_data.py -d data
   uv run pytest --data=./data tests/accuracy/test_accuracy.py
   ```

5. **Update the Changelog:** For significant changes, add a summary to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

6. **Check Licensing:** Ensure you own the code or have rights to use it, adhering to appropriate licensing.

7. **Sign Your Commits:** Use signed commits to certify that you have the right to submit the code under the project's license:

   ```bash
   git commit -S -m "Your detailed commit message"
   ```

   For more on signing commits, see [GitHub's guide on signing commits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).

### Submitting Pull Requests

Once you've followed the above steps and are satisfied with your changes:

1. Push your changes to your forked repository.
2. Go to the original Model API repository you forked and click "New pull request".
3. Choose your fork and the branch with your changes to open a pull request.
4. Fill in the pull request template with the necessary details about your changes.

We look forward to your contributions!
